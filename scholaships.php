        <p>
        The Computer Science department is pleased to announce scholarships for computer science students. The Buhler Scholarship in Computer Science and the Cichanowski-Logelin Scholarship in Computer Science were awarded for the first time in the fall of 1994. The scholarships are awarded to outstanding junior or senior students on the basis of academic achievement, promise in the field of computer science, and financial need. Scholarships may be renewed for one year.

        Additionally, CS students are eligible for other University wide scholarships, work study and student help.
