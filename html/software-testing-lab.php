    <h2>About the Lab</h2>
    <p>WSU Computer Science students staff the Software Testing and Development Lab
       and work to provide services to local and regional businesses and industries.
       These services include testing, development, along with other computer and
       networking related technical services. WSU Computer Science students
       provide these services under the direction and supervision of 
       Computer Science faculty and staff.</p>
       
    <p>Although any WSU student can work at the Software Testing Lab,
       Computer Science students are typically given preference. Student
       work hours vary during the school year and during breaks. During 
       academic terms students may work 10 to 15 hours per week. 
       During breaks or the Summer they work 20 to 40 hours per week.</p>
