      <h1>Software Testing and Development Lab</h1>
	  
	  <h2>About the Lab</h2>
		<p>WSU Computer Science students staff the Software Testing and Development Lab
		   and work to provide services to local and regional businesses and industries.
		   These services include testing, development, along with other computer and
		   networking related technical services. WSU Computer Science students
		   provide these services under the direction and supervision of 
		   Computer Science faculty and staff.</p>
		   
		<p>Although any WSU student can work at the Software Testing Lab,
		   Computer Science students are typically given preference. Student
		   work hours vary during the school year and during breaks. During 
		   academic terms students may work 10 to 15 hours per week. 
		   During breaks or the Summer they work 20 to 40 hours per week.</p>
	  
	  <h2>How to Apply</h2>

		   for the next appointment cycle, but students should reapply
