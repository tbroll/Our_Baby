        Working with such rapidly changing technology requires an increasing level of skill and education on the part of employees. In addition to technical knowledge, companies want professionals who have communication and other interpersonal skills and can adapt their problem-solving skills to different situations.The Computer Science program at WSU is designed to prepare students in exactly these ways. Our majors take courses to develop not only their programming skills and technical knowledge, but also their communication and critical thinking skills. </p> 

        <p>Students are also given opportunities, both inside and outside the classroom, to apply their knowledge to real-world problems. Students take applied computer science courses/tracks relative to areas such as bioinformatics, business and psychology. Through service-learning, independent research projects, and internships, they also have the opportunity to work one-on-one with faculty in specialized areas, such as </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Digital Image Processing</li>
          <li>Computer Assistive Technology</li>
          <li>Game Technology</li>
          <li>Embedded Systems</li>
          <li>Database Design</li>
          <li>Web Programming</li>
          <li>Software Engineering</li>
          <li>Networking and Security</li>
        </ul>

        <p>   
         By combining these opportunities, the department is able to prepare students for long-term success in the computer science field.

         Computer science majorschoose between two options: Computer Science and Applied Computer Science. Both options require a common core set of courses designed to give students a fundamental understanding of both theoretical and applied computer science.
         </p>
        <p>
      In addition to the programs for the Computer Science Major, the department offers a Computer Science Minor and a Computer Technology Minor.
      And, as part of Winona Stateâ€™s laptop program, our students have access to state-of-the-art computers at all times.
